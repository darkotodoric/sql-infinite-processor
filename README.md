# SQL Infinite Processor
This is the right approach to processing billions of rows in a MySQL database. This repository demonstrates the optimal method for handling large-scale data queries in SQL, bypassing common inefficiencies.

## Problem with traditional SQL queries
Typical SQL queries using `LIMIT` with an offset are not efficient for large datasets. This is because MySQL loads all the data first, and then only returns the specified number of rows as defined in the `LIMIT` clause. This method becomes increasingly inefficient as the dataset grows larger.

## Right solution
This approach provides a better alternative, applicable across different programming languages. While this example utilizes PHP, the fundamental concept is deeply rooted in SQL principles.
This data processing method is superior because it iteratively fetches manageable chunks of data based on the last processed ID, ensuring memory efficiency. It avoids the performance hit typical in OFFSET-based pagination, particularly in large datasets, as it doesn't need to skip over rows. This approach is also scalable, handling millions to billions of rows without performance degradation, making it ideal for large-scale data operations.
